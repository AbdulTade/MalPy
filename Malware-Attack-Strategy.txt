Since Malware is mostly written in python it needs a python interpreter to run the most core parts of the Malware
The malware will be a ransomware/persistent-keylogger.
So the first stage of the malware is to build it as executable msvc c++ binary so that it can run natively on any
windows OS version. Since I am using it as a demonstration it might be restricted to windows 8 and higher.

The base malware which is a loader would first test the existence of python interpreter on the system. If it exists it would then
test the existence of the required libraries for it to execute. if the python interpreter does not exist it downloads python from
python.org by performing a test of the platform in which the python script is to execute. e.g if the platform is windows on an amd64 
cpu it should download the source that matches the platform accordingly. If they exist it proceeds with unpacking the script from a logo
image in which it is embedded which ships with the executable. If the required libraries do not exist it first installs the python package manager
and uses it to install the required libraries. 

After making all the neccessary setups and installations needed, it makes changes to certain registry keys that point to the python keylogger which will run as a background
service. This is an attempt to make the malware persistent on reboot. There are many security evation techniques like Process doppelganging and process reimaging techniques but they are
very advanced and the limited time wouldn't allow me to use them. But what I can do is to make the created process have a very low memory,cpu and network usage footprint so it does not cause a noticeable 
performance impact on the computer which would otherwise generate red flags to the user of the infected computer.

It will place a ransome note with the name "_readme.txt" on the Desktop which will contain the instructions on payments to made by the user. Whether the ransomware part fails or not
it installs a keylogger into the directory "C:\\Program Files" (subject to change) and then modifies specific registry keys to point to keylogger script so that it is 
started on the next boot (Persistence). keylogger script collects processor information and information of the infected device and bundles it together with the keylogs and send it over
email to the hackers computer in this case my email at regular time intervals set by the hacker. So the malware will persist upon every reboot. So even if the ransomeware is noticed the
keylogger will still persist which would increase our chances of successfull execution of the malware binary.
